# Setup Service Discovery Using Nginx & Consul

**Introduction**

This project deals with setting up web servers, a load balancer and service discovery. The service discovery will make use of Nginx and Consul. 
The service discovery idealizes the following:   Service Registration, Service Registry, Service lookup/Discovery, and Health Checks.

**Dynamics:**

1.	Deploy four Ubuntu Servers.

2.	Allow required ports in the security group

3.	Consul servers

4.	Set up Consul server
     
     a. After instulling Consul
     
     b. Confirm Consul by checking it's version with the consul --version command.

    c. We rename consul.hcl.back by using the following command sudo mv /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl.back

   d. Generate an encrypted key using the  consul keygen command.

   e. A new file name was created, consul.hcl in the /etc/consul.d directory using the following command sudo vi /etc/consul.d/consul.hcl

   f. Add the following to the consule file consul.hcl and replace encrypt with your encrypted key.


```

   "bind_addr" = "0.0.0.0"

"client_addr" = "0.0.0.0"

"data_dir" = "/var/consul"

"encrypt" = "<YOUR_ENCRYPTED_KEY>"

"datacenter" = "dc1"

"ui" = true

"server" = true

"log_level" = "INFO"

```

  g. Run the following command to start the Consul server in the background: sudo nohup consul agent -dev -config-dir /etc/consul.d/ &



![4](img/img13.png)


   h. You can check the Consul server with following command:consul members


![4](img/img14.png)


   i. A visit to <EC2 Consul Server IP>:8500, you will be able to access the Consule dashboard.

5.	Set up Backend servers

    a. SSH into the Backend servers and run     sudo apt-get update -y


![5](img/img16.png)


![5](img/img17.png)


    b. Enter the following command to navigate to the HTML directory: cd /var/www/html


![5](img/img19.png)



   c. Open the HTML file with your preferred text editor to make edits: sudo vi index.html

   d. The following configuration was pasted and SERVER 01 was replaced with SERVER 02 for the second Backend HTML file to differentiate them.

  
  
   e. Install Consul as an agent on the servers

   f. Verify if the Consule is installed properly with the following command: consul --version


![5](img/img23.png)


  g. Replace the default Consul configuration file
 
 

  h. Rename the default file and create a new one


![5](img/img24.png)


![5](img/img25.png)


   i. Verify the configurations by executing the following command: consul validate /etc/consul.d

   j. start the Consul agent with the following command: sudo nohup consul agent -config-dir /etc/consul.d/ &


   ![5](img/img26.png)



    k. To verify if everything is working correctly, visit your Consul UI.

6.	Set up Load-Balancer


![6](img/img30.png)


    b. Install Nginx using the following command: sudo apt install nginx -y

```

    c. Download the consul-template binary using the following command:
   
    sudo curl -L  https://releases.hashicorp.com/consul-template/0.30.0/consul-template_0.30.0_linux_amd64.zip -o /opt/consul-template.zip

    sudo unzip /opt/consul-template.zip -d  /usr/local/bin/

```


![6](img/img31.png)


    d. To verify the installation of consul-template, check its version with the following command: consul-template --version.


![6](img/img32.png)


    e. Create and edit a file named load-balancer.conf.ctmpl in the /etc/nginx/conf.d


![6](img/img33.png)


    f. Use the following command to create and edit the file: sudo vi /etc/nginx/conf.d/consul-template.hcl

    g. Add the following content to the file and replace <Consul Server IP> with your Consul server's IP address, and the command to reload Nginx after updating the configuration.


![6](img/img34.png)



     h. Delete the default server configuration to disable it by running the following command: sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.

```
     i. Delete the default server configuration to disable it by running the following command: sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default.

```
     j. Restart Nginx to apply the changes by running the following command: sudo systemctl restart nginx.

```

     k. Once configurations are complete, start the Consul Template agent using the following command. It continuously monitors Consul for changes:

```

     sudo nohup consul-template -config=/etc/nginx/conf.d/consul-template.hcl &


![6](img/img35.png)



     l. Upon completion, a load-balancer.conf file will be created with backend server information populated from the Consul service registry.


![6](img/img36.png)


     m. Load your Loadbalancer IP to your web browser.
