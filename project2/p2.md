6.	To insatall Nginx and set my websites. I executed the following commands  sudo apt on 
       sudo apt upgrade         sudo apt install nginx
7.	Start Nginx by running the  sudo systemctl start nginx  command, sudo systemctl enable nginx. This is to enable it to start on boot, 
and then I confirmed if it is running using sudo systemctl status nginx  command.

11.	To install the unzip tool, run the following command: sudo apt install unzip
12.	Execute the command to download and unzip your website files sudo curl -o /var/www/html/2098_health.zip https://www.tooplate.com/zip-templates/2134_gotto_job.zip && sudo unzip -d /var/www/html/ /var/www/html/2134_gotto_job.zip && sudo rm -f /var/www/html/2134_gotto_job.zip
13.The second website was also downloaded sudo curl -o /var/www/html/2135_mini_finance.zip https://www.tooplate.com/zip-    templates/2132_clean_work.zip && sudo unzip -d /var/www/html/ /var/www/html/2135_mini_finance.zip && sudo rm -f /var/www/html/2135_mini_finance.zip.

14.To set up website configuration in a new file in Nginx sites-avaialable directory. The following command was used sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/job

15. server {
    listen 80;
    server_name example.com www.example.com;

    root /var/www/html/example.com;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
16. Root directory changed to “root/var/www/html/2137_gotto_job”

    }
}
19. Root directory changed to “root/var/www/html/2135_mini_finance”

20. I created a symbolic link by running the following command  sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/job /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
    sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/finance /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
21.Run the sudo nginx –t  command.
22. Delete the default files in the sites-available and sites-enabled directories by executing the following commands:
         sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-available/default
   sudo rm /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/default

23. Restart the Nginx server by executing the following command: sudo systemctl restart nginx
24.create an A record in route 53, select domain name and click create record.

28. I have to run the following command on terminal sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/job.
   I entered the name of my domain (server_name job.ovodom.store www.job.ovodom.store;) and saved.
29. The same process was done for website 2. Domain name, server_name finance.ovodom.store www.finance.ovodom.store; edited and saved.
